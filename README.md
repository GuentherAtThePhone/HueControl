## Welcome to HueControl

Current Version: 1.0.0
HueControl is a WPF desktop applicatiion to control your Philips Hue Bridge.
This doesn´t only work with Hue bulbs but with all supported lights like Ikeas Tradfri.
Moreover not only lights are supported but SmartPlugs as well, like the one from Osram.
In theory this application can be extended to work with every ZigBee device that can be connected to the Philips Hue Bridge.

If your device isn´t supported, you can try fix it yourself or you can Contact me.
